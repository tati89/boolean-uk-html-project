          <h1>Mesotherapy</h1>
          <p>
            During each session, you may or may not have numbing medicine
            applied to your skin. You’ll get a series of injections using a
            special short needle. The needle may be attached to a mechanical gun
            to deliver many injections in a row.
          </p>
          <p>
            The injections can be given at different depths — from 1 to 4
            millimeters into your skin — depending on what condition you’re
            having treated. Your doctor may place the needle into your skin at
            an angle, or flick their wrist very quickly while injecting. Each
            injection may only place a tiny drop of the solution into your skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            You’ll probably need several mesotherapy sessions to get the desired
            effect. You should expect to return to the doctor between 3 to 15
            times. At first, you’ll get the injections every 7 to 10 days. If
            your skin starts to improve, the treatments will be stretched out to
            once every two weeks or once a month.

          <h1>Threads</h1>
          <p>
            Threads face lift or mesothreads will help to solve the problems of
            age-related changes. It is this procedure that provides a powerful
            instant face lifting and eliminates age-related sagging of the skin.
          </p>
          <p>
            A thread lift is a type of procedure wherein temporary sutures are
            used to produce a subtle but visible "lift" in the skin. Instead of
            removing the patient's loose facial skin surgically, the cosmetic
            surgeon simply suspends it by stitching up portions of it. This has
            the effect of pulling the skin back slightly and therefore lifting
            and tightening the face. In addition to being ideal for lifting the
            skin, threads combat aging in another way: by provoking the body's
            "healing response" and causing the body to direct large surges of
            collagen to treated areas. This is important because of the vital
            role collagen plays in the aging process.
          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, this process provides ongoing and progressive
            rejuvenation for the facial tissues. Patients who have a thread lift
            for the purpose of stimulating collagen will notice a gradual
            improvement in their skin's tone and firmness. While their threads
            are in place, the body's healing response will be constantly
            activated because the body will want to "heal" the sutured areas and
            expel the sutures. The body is biologically programmed to react this
            way when it senses any foreign object present within the dermis.
            Fortunately, because the threads placed under the skin during a
            thread lift are so small, the patient will not feel any of this
            happening. Most people cannot feel their sutures at all once the
            skin has healed around them.

          <h1>Botulinum therapy</h1>
          <p>
            Botulinum toxin therapy (also known as Botox) is used to treat a
            range of neurological conditions and disorders for adults and
            children, including dystonia, spasticity and migraine.
          </p>
          <p>
            Botulinum toxin is a therapeutic muscle relaxing agent that is
            injected through a very fine needle. It weakens overactive muscles
            or reduces sweat gland production, offering sustained relief from
            symptoms. The effects of botulinum toxin therapy typically last
            longer than other treatments, reducing the number of visits patients
            need to make to hospital.
